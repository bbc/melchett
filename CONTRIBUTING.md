# Contributing

Welcome to `melchett`, the plugin-based HTTP client for NodeJS. Thanks for your interest in contributing.

Here's how to get involved...

## Questions, Comments, and Feedback
> "Don't ask to ask, just ask!"

Rather than opening an issue, contact Lovely Horse development team through either of the following methods;
* Message `#team-lovely-horse` in the D+E iPlayer & Sounds Slack workspace
* Email [D&EPlatformLovelyHorse@bbc.co.uk](mailto:D&EPlatformLovelyHorse@bbc.co.uk?subject=Question%20or%20comment%20about%20melchett) (note this is also delivered to Lovely Horse Product, Project, BA, QA, and UX)

## Reporting Issues
Before opening a new issue, first check that there is not already an [open issue or Pull Request](https://github.com/bbc/melchett/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen) that addresses it.

If there is, make relevant comments and add your reaction. Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:
* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

1. Pick an appropriate template for the type of issue [from here](https://github.com/bbc/melchett/issues/choose)
2. Provide as much detail as possible
3. Follow your issue in the issue tracking workflow

## Contributing Code
If you do not have push access to the repository, please [fork it](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo). You should then work on your own `master` branch.

Otherwise, you may clone this repository and create a working branch with a _kebab-case_ name reflecting what you are working on (e.g. `fix-the-thing`).

Follow the setup instructions in the [README](../README.md).

Ensure all your code is thoroughly tested and that this testing is detailed in the pull request.

If your changes involve a significant architectural decision, don't forget to document this in an [ADR](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records) in the [`docs/arch`](docs/arch) folder.

## Pull Request Process
1. Read and complete all relevant sections of the PR template
2. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of two other developers
